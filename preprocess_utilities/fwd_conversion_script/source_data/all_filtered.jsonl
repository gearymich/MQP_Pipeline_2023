{"id":400,"text":"Hindustan Times. 2021-09-15 08:07:53+05:30. Snake venom estimated to be worth Rs 1700000000.0 has been seized from many districts of West Bengal since 2017. 1 such consignment was seized last week, bearing a familiar yet mysterious tag \u2013 Red Dragon Made in France Code No 6097.\n\nThe red dragon code, which means good fortune, has baffled the investigators for over 4 years as they have not managed to get to the kingpins of the illegal trade while carrying out arrest of small-time couriers, caught with venom stored in crystal jars, a wildlife crime control bureau officer said.\n\nSnake venom is believed to be used in traditional Chinese medicines as antidotes and by high-end drug abusers. It has been recovered in states such as Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Bihar and Punjab in the past few years with Bengal considered the hub of its smuggling. In all these cases, only couriers have been caught and the commonality was the red dragon code.\n\n\u201cWe are still not sure about its origin, destination country and end use. What we do know is that it usually enters India through Bangladesh and is meant to be smuggled out through Nepal and Bhutan,\u201d said Agni Mitra, deputy director (eastern region) of Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB).\n\n1 of the theories considered by investigators suggests that the venom originates from snake farms in Thailand and smuggled through Bangladesh, India and Nepal for its final destination either in China or in European countries. They also believe that in recent years, snake venom was extracted in places such as Tamil Nadu and Bihar for foreign clients and have not ruled out the possibility of it being used as a drug in India.\n\nThe suspicion that the venom was headed to European countries is based on the Made in France label on the jars. In 2017, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence seized 1 kilogram of cobra venom in Bihar and said it was being smuggled to France from India. However, the directorate officials did not provide any information linking France with the illegal venom business.\n\nLast Friday, the Border Security Force (BSF) seized 3 jars with the same code, containing around 7 kilograms of suspected snake venom in 3 forms \u2013 crystalline, liquid and powder. Top officials of the agency said it could cost around Rs 570000000.0 in the illegal market.\n\n\u201cThe jar had markings: Cobra SP \u2013 Red Dragon \u2013 Made in France \u2013 Code No 6097. No 1 was arrested since the jars were recovered from an unattended, under construction house at Dakshin Dinajpur in north Bengal,\u201d said a senior officer of the BSF\u2019s north Bengal frontier.\n\nIn February 2021, BSF found snake venom estimated to be worth Rs 240000000.0 from Uttar Dinajpur district, which was being smuggled to Nepal in jars having the same marking. These instances reminded officials of the West Bengal forest department of similar seizures way back in 2017 and 2018 when some of the first consignments were seized in north Bengal.\n\n\u201cBack then, the venoms were seized in crystal glass jars and sealed. They had the same markings: Cobra SP \u2013 Red Dragon \u2013 Made in France \u2013 Code No 6097. We had intercepted at least 11 such jars in 3 consignments and arrested 17 persons from north Bengal,\u201d said a forest official associated with the case. All of them told officials that they were just couriers and knew nothing about the smuggling racket.\n\nIn 1 consignment, 4 kg snake venom was seized, officials said, estimating it to cost between Rs 25\u201330 crore in the international illegal market. In other cases in 2017-18, venom, estimated to be worth Rs 700000000.0, was found, officials said.\n\nTo find out what type of venom was in the jars, the West Bengal forest department sent at least 20 jars to the Haffkine Institute for Training Research and Testing in Mumbai, which confirmed it to be snake venom. A former official at the Haffkine Institute, on the condition of anonymity, said that the jars came sealed with the instruction to use a laser gun to break the seal.\n\n\u201cWe had a tough time as we were not sure what was inside it. It could have been anything from venom to explosive to some radioactive material. It was only when the analysts from both the defence research wing and BARC ruled out the presence of radioactive material or explosive that the jars were opened and tested. We found a combination of venoms in various jars,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe analysis by Haffkine Institute made investigators consider the possibility that the venom was being smuggled back to India after some additions to turn it into a high-value drug. The venom in some of the jars was found in powder form, which the investigators believe could be for drug peddling. The jars found in Uttar Dinajpur last week had white powder; sugary crystalline and coca cola colour liquid, making investigators believe that the venom was for use as a party drug.\n\nHowever, arrested couriers claim that the venom comes from Bangladesh and is headed to China via Nepal and Bhutan for use in traditional Chinese medicines.\n\n\u201cIn some cases, a booklet was found with the jars, written in Thai language, which led investigators to suspect that the venom could have originated there and in other countries in south-east Asia. It was learnt that some farms in Thailand bred venomous snakes in clay water pots in banana plantations,\u201d said a second WCCB official, who refused to be named.\n\nHe said Indian officials had taken up the matter with their counterparts in China and Thailand in the past with little headway.\n\n\u201cThere was, however, no breakthrough. While the Chinese officials said that they produced their own snake venom and had no information of such illegal trade, Thailand officials too denied having any related information,\u201d said the WCCB official quoted above.\n\nWildlife activists are also puzzled about the tag, the smuggling route and the consignment quantity. \u201cThe route seems to be rather illogical,\u201d said Tito Joseph, program coordinator of Wildlife Protection Society of India.\n\n\u201cIf we assume that Bangladesh is the origin, or even if it is a transit country, then why would someone take a longer route through north Bengal and then through Nepal and Bhutan to reach China when this could be easily done through Myanmar.\u201d\n\nHe said that there were rumours that the snake venom was smuggled for use in drug parties as a substitute for narcotics in India and Nepal.\n\nExperts also said that snake venom is required in very small quantities to produce anti-venom. Venom is injected in horses and when antibodies are produced in sufficient quantities, they are drawn and cultured to produce anti-venom.\n\n\u201cBut that is required in very minute quantities and procured legally in India. Several kilos of venom seized over the years could be sufficient to meet the world\u2019s requirement for a few years,\u201d said a senior official of Bengal Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals, which earlier used to produce anti-venom."}

Poaching of the animal for the illegal trade of its skin and other body parts is strictly banned.\n\nForest officials said such illegal trade and transit has increased over the last few years and teams are often on alert to track such criminals. The operation often involves coordination from forest and wildlife departments from other states as well.\n\nA senior forest department official explained that even though Delhi is not a hub for wildlife-related crimes, it is an important transit 0 from where poachers and middlemen transport animals, dead and alive, and their body parts.\n\n\u201cAfter illegally poaching protected animals such as leopards, tigers, crocodiles, and even trading several protected species of birds from the jungles of Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, West Bengal among other places, these illegal traders often use Delhi as a transit 0 to take these items further into north east India and then across border to Nepal, Bhutan or China.
