{"id":400,"entities":[],"relations":[],"text":"Hindustan Times. 2021-09-15 08:07:53+05:30. Snake venom estimated to be worth Rs 1700000000.0 has been seized from many districts of West Bengal since 2017. 1 such consignment was seized last week, bearing a familiar yet mysterious tag \u2013 Red Dragon Made in France Code No 6097.\n\nThe red dragon code, which means good fortune, has baffled the investigators for over 4 years as they have not managed to get to the kingpins of the illegal trade while carrying out arrest of small-time couriers, caught with venom stored in crystal jars, a wildlife crime control bureau officer said.\n\nSnake venom is believed to be used in traditional Chinese medicines as antidotes and by high-end drug abusers. It has been recovered in states such as Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Bihar and Punjab in the past few years with Bengal considered the hub of its smuggling. In all these cases, only couriers have been caught and the commonality was the red dragon code.\n\n\u201cWe are still not sure about its origin, destination country and end use. What we do know is that it usually enters India through Bangladesh and is meant to be smuggled out through Nepal and Bhutan,\u201d said Agni Mitra, deputy director (eastern region) of Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB).\n\n1 of the theories considered by investigators suggests that the venom originates from snake farms in Thailand and smuggled through Bangladesh, India and Nepal for its final destination either in China or in European countries. They also believe that in recent years, snake venom was extracted in places such as Tamil Nadu and Bihar for foreign clients and have not ruled out the possibility of it being used as a drug in India.\n\nThe suspicion that the venom was headed to European countries is based on the Made in France label on the jars. In 2017, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence seized 1 kilogram of cobra venom in Bihar and said it was being smuggled to France from India. However, the directorate officials did not provide any information linking France with the illegal venom business.\n\nLast Friday, the Border Security Force (BSF) seized 3 jars with the same code, containing around 7 kilograms of suspected snake venom in 3 forms \u2013 crystalline, liquid and powder. Top officials of the agency said it could cost around Rs 570000000.0 in the illegal market.\n\n\u201cThe jar had markings: Cobra SP \u2013 Red Dragon \u2013 Made in France \u2013 Code No 6097. No 1 was arrested since the jars were recovered from an unattended, under construction house at Dakshin Dinajpur in north Bengal,\u201d said a senior officer of the BSF\u2019s north Bengal frontier.\n\nIn February 2021, BSF found snake venom estimated to be worth Rs 240000000.0 from Uttar Dinajpur district, which was being smuggled to Nepal in jars having the same marking. These instances reminded officials of the West Bengal forest department of similar seizures way back in 2017 and 2018 when some of the first consignments were seized in north Bengal.\n\n\u201cBack then, the venoms were seized in crystal glass jars and sealed. They had the same markings: Cobra SP \u2013 Red Dragon \u2013 Made in France \u2013 Code No 6097. We had intercepted at least 11 such jars in 3 consignments and arrested 17 persons from north Bengal,\u201d said a forest official associated with the case. All of them told officials that they were just couriers and knew nothing about the smuggling racket.\n\nIn 1 consignment, 4 kg snake venom was seized, officials said, estimating it to cost between Rs 25\u201330 crore in the international illegal market. In other cases in 2017-18, venom, estimated to be worth Rs 700000000.0, was found, officials said.\n\nTo find out what type of venom was in the jars, the West Bengal forest department sent at least 20 jars to the Haffkine Institute for Training Research and Testing in Mumbai, which confirmed it to be snake venom. A former official at the Haffkine Institute, on the condition of anonymity, said that the jars came sealed with the instruction to use a laser gun to break the seal.\n\n\u201cWe had a tough time as we were not sure what was inside it. It could have been anything from venom to explosive to some radioactive material. It was only when the analysts from both the defence research wing and BARC ruled out the presence of radioactive material or explosive that the jars were opened and tested. We found a combination of venoms in various jars,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe analysis by Haffkine Institute made investigators consider the possibility that the venom was being smuggled back to India after some additions to turn it into a high-value drug. The venom in some of the jars was found in powder form, which the investigators believe could be for drug peddling. The jars found in Uttar Dinajpur last week had white powder; sugary crystalline and coca cola colour liquid, making investigators believe that the venom was for use as a party drug.\n\nHowever, arrested couriers claim that the venom comes from Bangladesh and is headed to China via Nepal and Bhutan for use in traditional Chinese medicines.\n\n\u201cIn some cases, a booklet was found with the jars, written in Thai language, which led investigators to suspect that the venom could have originated there and in other countries in south-east Asia. It was learnt that some farms in Thailand bred venomous snakes in clay water pots in banana plantations,\u201d said a second WCCB official, who refused to be named.\n\nHe said Indian officials had taken up the matter with their counterparts in China and Thailand in the past with little headway.\n\n\u201cThere was, however, no breakthrough.

Foresters from the Belakoba Range under the Baikunthapur forest division, led by range officer Sanjay Dutta, apprehended Chandra Prakash Chemjong, Govinda Sanba Limbu and Yakpu Sherpa, all Neapalese citizens, from the PWD More in Siliguri yesterday.\n\nAccording to sources, preliminary investigation had suggested that the men were \u201chabitual traders\u201d in wildlife articles. The accused persons had procured the hides from Nepal, they said. \u201cTheir purpose was to create a link between wildlife offenders with their counterparts of other countries. After finalizing the rate of the articles, they would deliver those to the nearby Indo-Bhutan border area, especially at Phuntsholing, the border town of Bhutan. In this particular case, the transaction amount was fixed at Rs 3000000.0.\n\nThey had procured the hides from Mikwakhola in Taplejung in Nepal and planned to deliver them to a Chinese customer through their Bhutan counterpart. It is an open secret that most of the wildlife trafficking cases have links to China as the value of wildlife articles is higher there,\u201d the sources said. The red panda has been listed as endangered under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.\n\nThe leopard is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because leopard populations are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, and are declining in large parts of the global range. Wildlife smugglers prefer the to-and-fro Nepal-north Bengal-Bangladesh-Bhutan corridor as their routes, foresters have said. Siliguri corridor, having close proximity with Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan, has emerged as most vulnerable to the smuggling of wildlife articles.\n\nThe articles are smuggled to China mostly through Bhutan and Nepal, they say. \u201cSmuggling of exotic birds and animals had been uncommon in north Bengal unlike wild animals until a few months ago, when 3 kangaroos were rescued on 1 April and 4 rare species of primates\u2013rescued from a passenger bus at Maynaguri in Jalpaiguri district on 10 May.\n\nThe forest department had earlier rescued live species like geckos, pangolins, red sand boa and seized a number of wildlife articles, including hides of the Royal Bengal tiger, leopards, elephant tusks, snake venom, tiger bones, and rhino horns, mostly through the Siliguri corridor starting from the Northeast.

The venom is believed to be from a cobra but chemical tests are being conducted to identify the snake species, Pradhan said, and informed that the recent incident is different from the 2014 case when the officials had also seized snake venom found in North Bengal but then the consignment was found in small quantity packed in gunny sacks, unlike those in this case where the venom had evidently undergone heavy processing and had come from very sophisticated sources.\n\n[related-post]\n\nThe glass containers are stamped with \u201cMade in France\u201d, Pradhan said, and added that the quantity is more puzzling as such a huge quantity would be more than a particular country\u2019s annual requirement.\n\nHowever, the absence of a dedicated investigative wing to deal with such cases is now being felt more acutely than even before. The Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife), Azam Zaidi said that recently the State Wildlife Advisory Board had adopted a resolution giving the go-ahead for setting up of a Wildlife Crime Control Bureau.\n\nThe multi-agency platform would exclusively look into trade, smuggling and clandestine dealings in wildlife items. A similar body exists at the national level with regional branches in some places but the State Forest Department felt the need to have its own Crime Control Bureau, said the PCCF.\n\nWildlife experts say illegal trade of snake venom and skin is widespread with frequent recoveries reported across the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExtracted venom is mostly used as an antidote for snake bites, which according to World Health Organization kill an estimated half a 1000000 people globally every year."}

But after a hot pursuit of around 7 km, police finally intercepted the vehicle.\n\nTo the LCB team\u2019s initial disappointment, the carrier area had just a mattress in it. But after sustained questioning, the driver, Suraj Ubale (24), spilled the beans and showed the police a hidden compartment under the carrier area.

Police subsequently placed the driver of the tempo, who was transporting the blocks, under arrest and launched a probe into the case.

We need to understand, only the inner core of the trunk, a couple of feet above and below the ground, are the valuable parts of the tree. For cutting and transporting a sandalwood tree, a permission from the Forest Department and transit permit is required. There are gangs active across the state, which chop off and steal the valuable parts of trees that they find in farms, bungalows, house premises or various types of forest areas. These chopped parts are then smuggled and sold to oil extraction units or other factories. These gangs, many times, have criminal elements associated with them. Coordinated efforts from police, forest department and awareness among people is needed to put a check on these illegal activities.

BHOPAL: The special task force (STF) of the wildlife wing of Madhya Pradesh forest department have apprehended 2 persons from Odisha who were wanted in connection with the Indo-China pangolin syndicate.This is the 189th arrest in the country\u2019s biggest ever poaching network cracked by the STF. Remaining 187 were arrested from 14 states in the last 7 years.Accused Shamsuddin Khan of Khurda district and Kurban Ali \u2013 resident of Brahmpur Ganjam were on STF\u2019s radar during investigations into a turtle poaching syndicate operating in MP-UP area. They were on the run for the last 7 years.Officials suspect this gang was behind poaching of hundreds of Chambal turtles in the last few years, for consumption and supply to some hotels in the 2 states besides smuggling it to foreign countries.They are said to be associated with the international poaching syndicate involved in smuggling pangolin scales to China and Vietnam. The MP forest department had cracked the network with the arrest of its kingpin. Interpol\u2019s help was also being sought.Pangolin scales, which are a rage in China for its aphrodisiac properties, are now hot property of party animals in America. A recent Interpol report states that 26% scales of the endangered species are being routed to the US party circuit.While the Chinese fetish for pangolins was well-known and triggered the crackdown on the racket with Myanmar links, the spiralling use of its scales for manufacture of crystal methamphetamine, an ingredient of the party drug popularly known as crystal meth, crank, speed or ice had been giving Madhya Pradesh forest special task force another headache. STF has also approached the narcotics wing of the state police for assistance after the scam kingpin, a Myanmar national, made fresh revelations.Scales contain Tramadol HCL, which is a substance binder particle found in psychotropic drugs like methamphetamine and this makes pangolin the most smuggled wild animal on earth, said STF sources.The ant-eating mammal with armour of keratin scales has been listed under Schedule 1 of Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 and International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as an endangered species. Experts said, \u201cIf poaching continues, pangolins could face extinction.\u201dOfficials claim there are 2 smuggling routes to China \u2014 Nepal through north Bengal and Myanmar through Manipur. Local poachers are paid Rs 6,000 for scales of an ant-eater, which weighs around 1.3 to 2 kg. It is resold for Rs 15,000 to middlemen and Rs 30,000 to those who export the animal. In the internationale market, it fetches 30 times more than poachers get as their cut.In traditional Chinese medicine, roasted pangolin scales are used for detoxification of blood, draining pus, curing palsy and stimulating lactation. Using its blood to treat asthma, cancer and reproductive problems is also a common practice in China.Pangolins are found mostly in south-eastern parts of Madhya Pradesh, especially Pachmarhi area of Hoshangabad, Chhindwara , Balaghat and Seoni districts of the state. Madhya Pradesh, which is largely focused on tiger conservation, does not have any project to protect this endangered mammal."}

Each shawl ranges between Rs 300000.0 to Rs 1000000.0, and 1 shawl apparently requires poaching of at least three-five of the animals. Forest officials seized 27 such shawls, worth more than a crore, and arrested 3 from Kashmir who were selling those along with Pashmina and Angora shawls.An endangered species listed in Schedule-I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act and Appendix-I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora , the Tibetian antelope (Pantholope hodgsonii) is also called Chiru and importation of any part or products of Pantholopes is prohibited by the US Law.\u201cInhabitants of the Tibetian plateau in China, a small population of the animals are found in the high Himalayas of Tibet, western China and far northern India, where they are killed for parts.

The 2 said they travelled from the Mizoram-Myanmar border and were heading for Siliguri for delivering the consignment,\u201d Hitesh Chandra Roy, the Superintendent of Police of Kamrup district told The Hindu.\n\nRangiya is about 55 km north-west of Guwahati.

Animals transported on the second route touch Dimapur in Nagaland.\n\nMost people arrested in Assam while transporting such animals said they were paid to deliver their consignments in West Bengal, specifically the Alipurduar-Cooch Behar-Jalpaiguri-Siliguri belt.\n\nThis became more than apparent when Forest officials in West Bengal found 4 kangaroos in the Gajoldoba area of Jalpaiguri in April. 2 more kangaroos \u2013 1 dead, the other injured \u2013 were found in the Dabgram forest range.\n\nThe West Bengal Forest officials also rescued 4 monkeys smuggled from Indonesia from a Siliguri-bound bus around that time.\n\nIn July 2020, The Assam Forest officials seized a red kangaroo, 6 hyacinth macaw, 2 capuchin monkeys from South Africa and 3 Aldabra giant tortoises from a truck near the State\u2019s border with Mizoram.\n\nIn March, the Assam police found macaws, silvery marmosets, and golden-headed tamarin \u2013 all exotic animals from Brazil\u2019s Amazon \u2013 while conducting routine checks in Golaghat district. These animals were smuggled via Moreh, officials said.\n\n\u201cThere seems to be a craze for keeping exotic animals as pets, which is fuelling the animal trafficking racket. But the biggest worry is that these animals, unlike those exchanged by zoos, come in without health screening, thus posing the risk of spreading diseases,\u201d Bibhab Talukdar of the Assam-based green group Aaranyak said."}

On Saturday morning, the carcass of a kangaroo was found in the Farabari area nearby, taking the number of kangaroos recorded in north Bengal to four.\n\n\u201cThis is very unusual for us \u2014 to rescue kangaroos, which are not native to the continent [of Asia]. Earlier, we have rescued animals that were being smuggled through the corridor that starts from the northeast [of India] to north Bengal, and we heightened security,\u201d Debal Roy, Principal Chief Conservator of Forest and Chief Wildlife Warden-North Bengal, said. Mr. Roy added that there had been inputs from informants on the smuggling of animals, and security had been increased on the roads to apprehend wildlife smugglers.\n\nWhile no 1 has been arrested and the forest official are not sure where these animals were heading, he pointed out that kangaroos were certainly being transported in small containers inside cramped spaces, and the moment the smugglers got a whiff of security checks, they left the animals on the forested roadside and slipped away. Hari Krishnan, Divisional Forest Officer (DFO), Baikunthpur Forest Division, said that the rescued kangaroos had been handed over to the Bengal Safari Zoo in Siliguri. He confirmed that the rescued animals were sub-adults (not full grown).\n\nSmuggling of exotic birds and animals, mostly to be sold as pets, is not uncommon in West Bengal, owing to its geographical location, sharing its borders with the northeastern States, and Nepal and Bangladesh. The seizure of kangaroos is, however, a more complicated story. About a fortnight ago, forest officials seized 1 kangaroo in the Buxa Forest Division in north Bengal and arrested 1 person. The person in custody produced a \u201csupply order\u201d from the Indore Zoo. According to the rules of the Central Zoo Authority, zoos cannot purchase animals through a \u201csupply order\u201d. Animals can be procured for zoos through the exchange of other animals, or from the personal collection of people, or through donations. The supply order was directed to a farm in Mizoram. Sources in the West Bengal Forest Department said that their Chief Wildlife Warden had written to the head of Mizoram\u2019s Wildlife Department, and the latter had denied any such farm existed in that State.\n\nSpecies not native to India are not protected under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 but for the possession of species listed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), owners have to declare them in the \u2018Parivesh\u2019 portal of the Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change (MOEFCC). Meanwhile, the Wildlife (Protection) Amendment Bill, 2021 was introduced in the Lok Sabha, which seeks to increase the number of species protected under the law, and to implement the CITES.\n\nExperts said the kangaroos were being smuggled into India from Myanmar and from the northeast. Smuggling of exotic birds and animals, which are kept as pets and fetch a very high price, is an organised crime. In June 2019, a lion cub was rescued in Kolkata from wildlife smugglers."}

The Assam forest department on April 12 seized 5 caged siamangs from a vehicle in the state\u2019s Karbi Anglong district, reinforcing suspicions of a vibrant and completely illegal trade in exotic species, some of which are believed to originate from wildlife farms across the border in Myanmar.\n\nThe move comes 12 days after 3 kangaroos were found wandering around in a forested patch near Jalpaiguri; the carcass of a fourth was found a day later. Earlier, on March 12, police seized a kangaroo from a truck on the Assam-West Bengal border.\n\nKangaroos are endemic to Australia; siamangs to South-East Asia.\n\nJhon Das, the subdivisional police officer in West Karbi Anglong\u2019s Bokajan said the animals were discovered during a routine check of a Maruti Ecco van coming from Dimapur.\n\n\u201cAt around 5:30pm on Tuesday, officials from Dilai police station stopped the vehicle and found that there were some caged animals inside. The 2 persons inside the vehicle tried to flee but our officials managed to catch them,\u201d Das added. The 2 have been identified as Habibur Rahman (46) and Janab Khan (50), both residents of Sangaiyumpham village in Thoubal district of Manipur, police said. Vipin Bansal, assistant district forest official of Karbi Anglong East Division, confirmed that the seized animals are siamangs. \u201cOne is an adult, while the rest 4 are juveniles,\u201d he said.\n\nThe black-furred siamang is an ape, and the largest of the gibbons. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), of which India is a signatory, lists siamangs in Appendix 1, which means they are under threat of \u201cextinction\u201d and trade in the species is \u201cpermitted only in exceptional circumstances\u201d.\n\nIn the March 12 case involving the kangaroos, police detained the driver and cleaner of the truck (both from Hyderabad) who produced letters from the Indore zoo.\n\nThe 2 documents produced were a \u201cTransit Permission letter\u201d and a \u201cPurchase Order\u201d, both signed by the curator of the Kamla Nehru Prani Sangrahalay, popularly known as the Indore zoo. \u201cOne red kangaroo was being donated to us by a man named Thagtee based in Mizoram. He had contacted us saying that he was the owner of a farm dealing with exotic animals. It was, however, not the first time that he has donated animals to the Indore zoo. A few months back he had donated some budgerigars,\u201d said Nihar Parulekar, curator of the zoo.\n\nThe budgerigar is a bird widely in demand as a pet . A kangaroo is entirely different. Thagtee\u2019s motives for wanting to give away kangaroos aren\u2019t clear.\n\nThe other end of the chain led the police to investigate Thagtee, owner of the Buennel Farm in Mizoram. Yet, investigators have virtually no information about this man so far, failing to trace him. HT managed to procure a phone number reportedly belonging to Thagtee, but his phone was switched off, with SMS queries going unanswered.\n\nThe Mizoram forest department says it has no knowledge of farms dealing with exotic animals. The farm doesn\u2019t have a website. No address was mentioned on the documents apart from Buennel Farm.\n\nBut the failed transaction has triggered suspicion that illegal farms could be operating along the Indo-Myanmar border, and dealing with exotic species. \u201cIndian zoos can accept animals only through exchange with other zoos and donations; they can\u2019t purchase animals. Also, if any farm wants to deal with exotic animals such as red kangaroos they need to declare it on the Parivesh portal of the Union ministry of environment and forests. The chief wildlife warden of the state has to know,\u201d said Agni Mitra, deputy director (eastern region) of Wildlife Crime Control Bureau.\n\nThe seizure of the siamangs would appear to confirm that suspicion. Kangaroos, too, are covered by CITES but under Appendix 2, which means the species isn\u2019t under threat of extinction but that trade \u201cmust be controlled in order to avoid utilisation incompatible with their survival.\u201d It isn\u2019t clear why and how the Indore zoo authorities were happy to accept such an animal being donated by someone from Mizoram.\n\n\u201cWe had to make the payment for the transportation. Not the animal. It was being donated to us. In the document signed by us, it is also written that the animals must be from a legal source and with necessary documents. We would have had to produce all documents before the Central Zoo Authority after receiving the kangaroo,\u201d said Indore zoo\u2019s Parulekar.\n\nThe \u201cTransit Permission letter\u201d a copy of which is with HT, says that Thagtee would be delivering the product himself. But when the 2 persons were arrested, he was not among them. The 2 arrested were identified as SK Javed and SK Imran. They are now out on bail.\n\nOn April 1, 2 kangaroos were rescued at Gajoldoba, a tourist destination in Jalpaiguri district, near Siliguri, and a third at Farabari, around 40km away, also in Jalpaiguri. The next morning locals spotted the carcass of a fourth and alerted the forest department.\n\nThe Indore zoo said it knows nothing of the second consignment, and there has been little headway in investigations either. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any clue as of yet. As no persons were arrested we could not question anyone to get some clues,\u201d said Debal Roy, chief wildlife warden of West Bengal.\n\nBut other officers of the West Bengal state forest department and officials of the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau said that the animals (the kangaroos and the siamangs) may have originated from animal farms which exist in south-east Asian countries and may have entered India through the Indo-Myanmar border.\n\nAssam forest minister Parimal Suklabaidya said there is an international racket of smuggling animals which can be very large. The consignments enter to India from Myanmar through Manipur and Mizoram. \u201cWe tried to find the destination but we still don\u2019t have clear picture. There can be private zoos or people who like to keep caged exotic animals at home. There is possibility that this international racket is using India as a transit route only, and the animals and birds are going to international market through Bangladesh or other countries,\u201d Suklabaidya said.\n\nAdmitting that Guwahati has become an important transit 0 for smuggled exotic animals, the minister said locals from Manipur and Mizoram are just couriers, who don\u2019t know about the final destination or about its origin. \u201cThe persons we arrest, have little idea about who gave them the consignments. So, we don\u2019t find ways to catch the actual culprit,\u201d he said. Bansal added that the 2 arrested persons have told them that they were to be told about the person to whom the consignment was to be delivered when they would have reached Guwahati.\n\nWCCB officials said an international syndicate of exotic wildlife smugglers whose kingpin was based in Mizoram was busted by Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) in October 2018. Following that several operations were conducted and many animals and birds were rescued at the borders of north-eastern states.\n\nBansal said the siamangs are in good health and they have been examined by a local veterinary doctor. They will soon be sent to a zoo.\n\nMeanwhile, the 3 kangaroos found alive are recovering at an animal park near Sliguri.The first one, found on March 12, has been sent to the Kolkata zoo."}

Multiple instances of pangolin seizures in the recent past indicate the involvement of criminal networks in trapping and smuggling of the endangered animal.\n\nForest department officials arrested 6 persons on Sunday, including 2 from Pune, following the recovery of a pangolin from some of the accused, who were nabbed at Wele village in Wai tehsil of Satara district a day before. All of them have been booked under sections of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972.\n\nThey were produced before a court in Satara on Monday.\n\nRange Forest Officer Sachin Dombale, who is investigating the case, said, \u201cThe court remanded the 6 accused to the custody of the forest department for 3 days. During primary investigation, the accused said they got the pangolin from the side of a canal in Khandala area. The 2 accused from Pune were looking for a customer who will buy the pangolin. Further investigation is on. There is a possibility of a larger racket being involved.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso, with the permission of the court, we released the pangolin in its natural habitat today,\u201d said Dombale. Meanwhile, an identity card was recovered from 1 of the accused, which states that he is a member of a Pune-based wildlife and snake rescue organisation.\n\nRohan Bhate, a member of the Wildlife Crime Control Board of the government of India who was part of the operation, said, \u201cSuch self-proclaimed wildlife and snake rescuers are involved in illegal activities. We suspect there is a big racket behind the trapping, hunting and trafficking of pangolins.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn December 2019, a pangolin was found in Shukrawar Peth area of Karad town in Satara. It was suspected that some racketeers were trying to sell this pangolin. But they could not be traced during searches. Such cases of pangolin recovery were also reported in different parts of the state,\u201d said Bhate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking to The Indian Express, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (Wildlife-West), Sunil Limaye, said, \u201cCases of pangolin trafficking have been on the rise over the last 3 to 4 years. These incidents have been reported from various parts of Maharashtra. Along with being hunted for meat, the animal is also trafficked due to various beliefs about its scales, including it being an aphrodisiac\u2026 the animal is very vulnerable and easy to catch. Considering these factors, we have been working on building an extensive network of informants on the ground, using secret service funds available to us. The aim is to gather actionable intelligence. After taking action, prosecution in these cases is also crucial.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cVarious initiatives are also being undertaken to create awareness about the animal and its endangered status. On the enforcement front, the forest department is coordinating with the police, Wildlife Crime Control Bureau and other agencies. Putting a check on pangolin trafficking calls for multi-agency cooperation, which is happening.\u201d\n\nIn June this year, after seeing an advertisement on social media about the sale of pangolins, the Wildlife Crime Control Board, Mumbai, had initiated action, leading to the arrest of 7 persons from Biloli in Nanded district. 2 pangolins were rescued from them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong other cases, in January 2019, Pune City Police had recovered 1 pangolin, and seized pangolin scales in a separate case, within a week. Probe had revealed that the animal was to be sold for 7000000.0 and the scales for Rs 150000.0 per kg. 1 more pangolin was seized in June 2019.\n\nIn October 2019, Pune City Police had arrested 3 persons, who had a pangolin in thir possession, at Kharadi bypass .\n\nInvestigation by Pune Rural Police in September 2019, into the brutal killing of 2 persons in a forest area near Tamhini Ghat in July that year, had revealed that the murders were the fallout of a dispute among pangolin racketeers. The suspects arrested for murder had been booked over a pangolin smuggling racket in Raigad and Thane.\n\nOfficials suspect that multiple rackets might be active in some part of the state, in which 1 chain catches pangolins from forests and sells them to middlemen in other cities, who then sell them to smugglers.\n\nWhy is a pangolin so expensive?\n\nPangolin, also known as scaly anteater, is an insectivorous mammal which has hard scales of keratin on its body. According to experts, it is probably the most trafficked animal across the globe. 2 of 8 subspecies of the animal are found in India.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe animal has been given a protected status, as per Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act in the country. Pangolin scales are used in traditional oriental medicines, and also to make luxury items, which are sold illegally.\n\nPangolin meat is sold at a very high price in illegal markets. There have been cases of the animal being kept in houses in India, as there is a superstition that it brings prosperity."}

Authorities suspect that Mr Aggrawal used to export high quality ivory from there, said the senior WTI official.The suspect confessed his involvement in the illegal trade of ivory from the 90s. He used his company 'Art of India' which dealt in various artifacts from India to other countries and mixed ivory and ivory articles along with sandstone and resin statues to avoid detection.He also openly manufactured and displayed articles which looked and felt like ivory in various art exhibitions to attract customers for genuine ivory products, said the senior WTI official.During investigation, Mr Aggrawal confessed about hiding ivory and ivory articles in a rented room in east Delhi. He also gave a sketch of the location, marking the building in which he kept the ivory and ivory article, which he had preserved inside his house.He also said that he was compelled to move the illegal goods to a safer location after learning about the arrest of Brite and Preston, said the senior official.Mr Aggrawal used 1 of his employees to organize a room to store the goods.

According to sources, political pressure started building up from Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh after the arrest.\n\nDuring interrogation, Hussain and the vehicle\u2019s owner, Ateeq, were asked to leave. Due to this, the investigation team is not showing much interest in interrogating them further. So far, nothing has been found which can be linked to the smugglers in the case. Khandwa ranger Nitin Rajouria said that the investigation is going on right now.\n\nThe questions whose answers were sought from the alleged smugglers were:\n\n\u00a7 What is the vulture used for in the Gulf countries?\n\n\u00a7 Where is the wildlife brought from?\n\n\u00a7 Which other ports are used for smuggling the vultures?\n\n\u00a7 Where are the gang members spread?"}

They eat large quantities of cephalopods such as squid and cuttlefish. In most cases, the indigestible elements of their prey, such as the beaks and pens, are vomited out before digestion. Ambergris is a solid waxy substance originating in the intestine of the sperm whale (Physeter catodon).\n\nThere are conflicting opinions as to how ambergris emerges from the whale. Some believe that the whale regurgitates the mass, earning it its nickname, whale vomit. In Eastern cultures, ambergris is used for medicine and potions and as a spice; in the West, it was used to stabilise the scent of fine perfumes. Hence, it has been in high demand.\n\nAccording to Mumbai Police, 1 kg of ambergris is worth 10000000.0. Due to this, it is referred to as floating gold. The Egyptians used it as incense, and the Chinese called it \"dragon's spittle scent.\""}
