Kolkata: A day after two aquarium hobbyists in Kolkata were arrested for decorating their fish tanks with banned live corals, officers of Wildlife Crime Control Cell and Data Management Unit nabbed a dealer, Pintu Halder (36), from his shop at Dum Dum Chiria More on Monday evening, for dealing in corals. Banned reef building corals worth lakhs were seized. “We have also seized a database of customers and suppliers. We are trying to nab more such illegal traders and hobbyists,” said an officer of WCCB Halder kept corals, cultured them at his shop and sold at a price between Rs 1,500 to Rs 5,000 a piece. “The corals are sourced mostly from Lakhswadeep and Andaman and Niccobar islands and are smuggled across India,” said the officer.
