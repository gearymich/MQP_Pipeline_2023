[BODY]
KOLKATA: A group of forest officials was allegedly held captive by the aides of an illegal coral trader at Ghola , a market in North 24 Parganas, for three hours on Thursday when they had gone there to conduct a surprise raid. The officials were rescued by the local police who escorted them back to their Salt Lake office. Cops arrested two persons and recovered a huge cache of corals from their possession.The raid had followed the arrest of a dealer of banned corals and two others in Kolkata and New Town. Scanning a list of databases maintained by the Dum Dum-based dealer, Pintu Halder — who was arrested last Monday — the officials of Wildlife Crime Control Cell WCCC ) and Data Management Unit raided a shop in Ghola on Thursday afternoon, posing as customers.“We found many dead corals with the accused. We gave our identities and asked the two employees of the shop to call their owner immediately. They called the owner who said that he would be coming in a while. But he never turned up. Instead, while we were trying to leave the place with the two employees, we were stopped by a large number of people in the area,” said an official. “We are looking for the owner of the shop who is absconding. On Friday, he has posted a video on YouTube, claiming what he was trading is not illegal. But it is not true,” said a senior officer of WCCC.
