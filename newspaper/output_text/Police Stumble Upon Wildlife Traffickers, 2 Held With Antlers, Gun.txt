JAIPUR: A crime branch unit while acting on an illegal arms supplier stumbled upon a possible network of wildlife traffickers after it recovered two antlers of Barasingha (swamp deer) during a raid on Thursday.Additional DCP (crime), Karan Sharma said that the police have arrested two accused, Ankit Singh (28), and Arjun Singh (26) from Jaisinghpura Khor. Besides one illegal firearm and seven live cartridges, the team also discovered antlers during their search from the hideout of the accused.“The accused are brothers and claimed to have purchased the firearms for Rs 25,000 from New Delhi. They are drug addicts with a history of snatching chains, mobiles, purses and wallets,” said an official.Police said that they tried to speak to the accused about how they came to acquire antlers but in vain.“The accused were drug-addled and hence, they could not respond to our queries,” said the official, adding that the accused were suspected to be connected with wildlife traders. “It is likely that they had brought it from someone else to sell it to another customer. We are probing the nexus,” the official said.In 2018, the city police had unearthed a similar racket when it arrested two accused with tiger skin and fake silver coins.“Previous experience indicates that the wildlife traders often work with other smuggling gangs. Similarly, in this case, the two accused may have come across a different gang who slipped them antlers,” said the official.Jaipur police said that they were investigating the accused’s possible network of suppliers for further investigation.“We were acting on information about arms suppliers. But it was only after a complete search of the room that we discovered the antlers,” said the official.
